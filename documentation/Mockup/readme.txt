Tool：  
InVision, Adobe XD  
  
InVision is a free prototyping tool, we can use it to create interactive mock-up 
for our design. We also can share these mock-ups with our term member or clients.  

We use Adobe XD for designing websites. Adobe XD are easy to learn and a 
timesaving application since it’s symbols and grids   

Challenge:  
The challenge for Get Your Car mock-up is we don’t know what the feature we want 
to put on our website and what the layout we going to presenting in the beginning. 
That makes us need to keep change and spend more time on it. But after sprint 2, 
we are more familiar with the project and know what the main feature we need,
that’s become much easy and fast to do mock-up.
